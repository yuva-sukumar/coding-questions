## ✅ Tips for DSA Preparation

- Start with **arrays and strings**  
- Practice **sorting + searching** thoroughly  
- Move to **recursion → stack/queue → linked list → hashmaps**  
- Explain **time & space complexity** for every solution  
- Focus on **clarity & approach**, not memorization  

> ⭐ If you solve **~80–90% of these**, you are **well-prepared for service-based DSA interviews**.
