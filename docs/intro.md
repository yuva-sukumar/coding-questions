# About Me

Hi, I’m Yuva 👋

I’m not here to motivate you with big words or unrealistic success stories ✨  
I’m just an **average girl** trying to build something of my own and share what I’ve learned along the way.

If my experiences help you even a little 🤍, I’d love for you to stay connected.

## My Journey into Tech 🌱

I didn’t start in computer science.

I come from a **biology background 🧬**, and my entry into tech began only when I started my bachelor’s in **Computer Science 💻**.  
Everything felt unfamiliar at first — concepts, coding, interviews, problem-solving.

I wasn’t fast.  
I wasn’t confident.  
And I definitely wasn’t a “top LeetCode solver.”

But I kept moving forward — **slowly and steadily 🚶‍♀️**.

## How I Learned (The Real Way) ⚙️

I didn’t push myself to extremes or follow hype-driven preparation 🚫🔥.

Instead, I chose:

- Understanding over memorizing 🧠  
- Consistency over speed ⏳  
- Smart preparation over random grinding 🎯  

I focused on what actually mattered for interviews and growth, not on solving hundreds of problems just for numbers.

## Where I Am Now 🏢

That approach helped me get placed in a **product-based company**.

Once I started working, I realized how much there still is to learn 📚.  
Even now, I sometimes feel behind — and that’s okay.

Growth in tech isn’t about feeling “done.”  
It’s about showing up, learning, and improving step by step 🌱.

## Why I Built This Space 💙

I created this platform to:

- Share my **real interview preparation experience** 🧩  
- Help you understand **what to focus on** based on your goals 🧭  
- Reduce confusion, pressure, and comparison 🌤️  

I’m not here to claim I know everything.  
I’m here to **learn, build, and grow — openly**.

## If You’re Like Me… 🤝

If you feel:

- Average  
- Late to tech  
- Slow compared to others  
- Unsure but still trying  

You’re not alone 🤍.

Let’s build, learn, and move forward — **one step at a time 🚀**.
