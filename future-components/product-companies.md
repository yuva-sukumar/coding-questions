## ✅ Tips for Product-Based DSA Preparation

- Master **arrays & strings first**, then **trees, graphs, DP, and backtracking**  
- Focus on **optimal solutions** (time & space complexity)  
- Solve **medium → hard** problems, not just easy ones  
- Always **think of edge cases and constraints**  
- Discuss **approach before coding** during interviews  

> ⭐ Solving **~70–80% of these questions confidently** is considered strong preparation for product-based interviews.
